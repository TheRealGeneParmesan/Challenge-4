# Challenge-4
Java quiz
In this javascript project when I start the quiz, a question is asked and a timer is started for 65 seconds. 
Every question that I get wrong decreases the time by 10 seconds and tells me that I got it wrong and every question I get right takes me to the next question. 
The last part is storing the answers and getting a tally, but I have not been able to get that to run yet as I am writing this readme.
